# Needed
* Name of target company or target person 
* Date of birth for person 
* Address for company
* Phone number of enterprise or person
* The current year for enterprise 

### Requirements 
* At least 4GB RAM 
* At least an i5 processor 
* 1-2 GB of free storage

I need to reorganize the code to allow multithreading to happen in order to save RAM, but I'm busy and this probably won't be happening any time soon.
